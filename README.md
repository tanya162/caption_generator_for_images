# Caption Generator for Images powered by Watson Visual Recognition

## PURPOSE

This project aims at building an application which takes input as image analyses it and generate the captions in the form of speech.
CCTV cameras are everywhere today if we can generate relevant captions, then we can raise alarms as soon as there is some malicious activity going on somewhere. This could probably help reduce some crime and/or accidents.

## TECHNOLOGIES USED

Artificial Intelligence powered by watson studio

## skills

PYTHON and Open cv and CNN

## IDEA

This project aims at building an application which takes input as image analyses it and generate the captions in the form of speech. To achieve this, we will be using IBM Services like node-red service to build a web UI where user uploads a picture. This picture is analyzed by visual recognition service and the analyzed description is then converted in to text to speech service using text to speech service
